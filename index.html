                <p class="text-white text-center"> We've tried to balance current form
                    with overall talent
                    as best we
                    can.
                    We hope you like the list, <br>
                    but we've been around the block enough times to
                    know that there will be plenty of dissent from
                    the gallery.
                    Which players are top scorers in the Europe <br> at the moment and how do they score? Who is the
                    best
                    player this season? <br> Check their ranking for different positions on the pitch, get a detailed
                    analysis and compare your favourite players.</p>
